# üéØ Mission and Social Impact

**INDX-C.IO SB** was founded with a clear vision: to empower emerging digital artists by promoting inclusion and equity through blockchain technology.

## üåç Our Mission

> **To create an NFT platform that is not just a marketplace, but a supportive ecosystem where each artwork sold helps other artists ‚Äî especially those underrepresented or with disabilities.**

INDX-C.IO is an *innovative startup* and a *Benefit Corporation*. This means our goal is not just profit, but the creation of measurable, long-term positive social impact.

## ü§ù Inclusion as a Driver of Innovation

In the world of digital art and NFTs, access to opportunity is often unequal. INDX-C.IO develops proprietary redistribution models to enhance the visibility and support of artists who would otherwise remain invisible in mainstream marketplaces.

Thanks to our **patented reputation algorithms**, the platform:

- Lowers the entry barrier to the NFT world  
- Makes the support mechanism between artists **transparent and automatic**  
- Enables **traceability and certification** of the social value generated  

## üí° Real Impact

Every NFT sold on INDX-C.IO contributes to:

- Funding new digital artists  
- Supporting the training and visibility of artists with disabilities  
- Promoting an inclusive and decentralized artistic culture  
- Activating circular economy mechanisms within the digital creative sector
